# Shapes and grids
Interactive browser applications that explore design-concepts.

## Concept
The examples will demonstrate or continue design-concepts and ideas such as proposed in the book "Programme Entwerfen" by Karl Gerstner.

## How to view?
The goal is to make it available on my hompage www.cma5.de. For the meantime, you have to download the repository. After downloading and unzipping, open index.html in your webbrowser and it should work. If that's not the case, you may have to start a local server like shown here: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server

## Project Status
Currently I'm getting the 1. example to work.
